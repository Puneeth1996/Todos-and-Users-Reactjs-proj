Create a new ReactJS project using create-react-app cli
Implement these packages
Redux
Ant Design (https://ant.design)
Any other as required
Create a single page at https://localhost:3000/
The purpose of the page is to maintain records for two resources (Todos and Users).  The user can perform functions like list, create, read, update and delete on each of the resources. The layout of the page is shown in the diagram below.


Fields for users:
name: string
email: string
Fields for Todo
action: string
dateAdded: datetime
The user clicks a �Create� button to bring up a modal window.  Upon clicking save in the modal window, the app will create a record of the resource and close the modal window. Note: No backend implementation is required.  The candidate only needs to maintain the data in the local storage.
Important criteria.
When clicking the save button in the modal window, the button should display a loading indicator (refer to https://ant.design/components/button)
Use this function to simulate a delay in saving
async function wait(duration = 1000) {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, duration));
}

await wait(2000);
/* Your action here (create/update resource) */
The modal window should be a reusable component in which the loading state is shared between the user and todo resources.  (No 2 loading state).

Note: 
1. The attachment below is for point no 4.
The functionality for TODO is same as Users. Please refer to the below for below details
A. TODO : fields are in email.
B. Functionality : Create / Update and delete TODOS.

2. Assignment to be submitted in 2-3 working days.

  For any clarification please feel free to mail me or call me.
